# Web Components Project: Landing Page Example

This project showcases the use of custom web components to create a landing page. The landing page includes various components such as a navigation bar, hero banner, stripe bars, an about section, services section, a contact form, and a footer. Each component is designed to be reusable and customizable, providing a modular and maintainable structure for web development.

## Features

- **Custom Web Components**: The landing page is built using custom web components, allowing for easy integration and reuse across different web applications.
- **Modular Design**: Each part of the landing page is encapsulated in its own web component, promoting separation of concerns and making the codebase easier to manage.
- **Responsive Design**: The components are designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring a good user experience on devices of all sizes.

## Installation

To use this landing page in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Include the Component Files**: Copy the JavaScript files for each component (`navbar-component.js`, `hero-banner-component.js`, `stripe-bar-component.js`, `about-component.js`, `services-component.js`, `contact-form-component.js`, `footer-component.js`) into your project's directory.

2. **Link the Components**: In your HTML file, include the JavaScript files for each component before the closing `</body>` tag.

   ```html
   <script src="path/to/navbar-component.js" defer></script>
   <script src="path/to/hero-banner-component.js" defer></script>
   <script src="path/to/stripe-bar-component.js" defer></script>
   <script src="path/to/about-component.js" defer></script>
   <script src="path/to/services-component.js" defer></script>
   <script src="path/to/contact-form-component.js" defer></script>
   <script src="path/to/footer-component.js" defer></script>
   ```

3. **Use the Components**: To add the components to your page, use the custom elements (`<navbar-component></navbar-component>`, `<hero-banner-component></hero-banner-component>`, `<stripe-bar-component></stripe-bar-component>`, `<about-component></about-component>`, `<services-component></services-component>`, `<contact-form-component></contact-form-component>`, `<footer-component></footer-component>`) in your HTML where you want each component to appear.

## Customization

To customize the components, you can modify the CSS styles within each component's JavaScript file. The styles are defined within the `<style>` tag in the template string. You can change colors, sizes, and other properties to match your website's design.
